## Git
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work.
Key Features:
Version Control: Track changes in your code over time.
Branching: Work on different features or fixes in isolation.
Merging: Integrate changes from different branches.
Distributed System: Each user has a full copy of the repository, allowing offline work.
## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides additional features for collaboration, project management, and code hosting.
Key Features:
Repositories: Store your projects online and share them with others.
Collaboration: Tools for team collaboration, including pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.
Social Features: Follow other developers, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects.
GitHub Actions: Automate workflows like testing and deployment.
## Git Bash
Git Bash is a command line interface for Git on Windows. It provides a Unix-like shell environment and allows you to use Git commands as well as bash commands.
Key Features:
Command Line Interface: Run Git commands in a terminal-like environment.
Bash Commands: Use common shell commands for file manipulation and navigation.
Cross-Platform: Similar to other command line tools like Terminal on macOS and Linux.
